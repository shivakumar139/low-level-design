Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that helps us to create objects with complex constructors or there are varieties of constructor.


# Problem: ðŸ¤¯
Imagine you need to create a `User` object with essential attributes like `firstName` and `lastName`, and some optional ones like `middleName` and `age`. To accommodate various combinations, you may end up creating multiple constructors, cluttering the class with overloaded constructors for each scenario.

# Solution: ðŸ¥³
Enter the Builder Design Pattern! It provides a cleaner way to construct objects, especially when dealing with numerous constructor variations. By separating the construction process from the object representation, it simplifies object creation by allowing us to specify only the required attributes and provide default values for the rest. This not only streamlines the class structure but also enhances its readability and maintainability.
